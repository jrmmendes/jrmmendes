### Hello!
Hi, My name is Junior Mendes (he/him) and I'm a backend developer! I'm currently using Python (Django REST Framework) and Javascript/TypeScript (Node.js), but I'm really interested about Go and its amazing community.

I love sharing skills, creating educational content and writing, then if you have something that I can help, get in touch with me!

### Things to know about me (for coworkers)
- ðŸ“Ÿ I love async/text based communication. You can message me any time - although maybe I'll reply latter;
- ðŸ‘‹ Use the "no hello" policy: [Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat](https://www.nohello.com/);
- ðŸ“… If you want me for some synchronous activity (e.g. google meet), send-me an invitation (on Google Calendar, Teams, etc);
